# PRODIGY_DS_02
Task-02: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this task, we perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset â€” for example, the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to understand the data, uncover relationships between variables, and identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights.

Steps involved:

Loading and inspecting the dataset.

Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.

Univariate analysis: Distribution of individual variables (e.g., age, fare).

Bivariate/multivariate analysis: Relationships between features (e.g., survival rate by gender, class).

Visualization using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

This process is crucial for identifying the quality and structure of the data and sets the foundation for further statistical analysis or machine learning modeling.
